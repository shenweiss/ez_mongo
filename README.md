# ez_mongo
Matlab scripts for editing EZPAC .MAT output files using the modified Brain Quick Annotations stored in the XML file and uploading the events (original or modified)
to a MongoDB. These scripts have been beta tested but shouldbe customized for your applications prior to routine use. Detailed instructions and caveats are included
in the .m files. I use the Database Toolbox Interface for MongoDB freely available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/64306-database-toolbox
interface-for-mongodb. Matlab has developed faster tools in the database toolbox. For now, I use the functions in the link appended above.
